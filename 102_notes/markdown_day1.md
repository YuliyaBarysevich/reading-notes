## _What is Markdown?_
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
