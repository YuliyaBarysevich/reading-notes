## Command Line

What is **_Command Line_**? It is a text interface for your computer.
It's a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer's operating system to run. From the command line, you can navigate
through files and folders on your computer.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

### Operating a Terminal (Command Line)

- **Linux**
    -Find it in **Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities**. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
- **Windows**
    -You will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .
