## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
    - Angular
    - Vue
    - Ember
    - Aurelia
    - Webix
2. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
    - Both libraries and frameworks are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help to solve common problems in easier ways.
    - The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the application flow. You choose when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides you with a few places to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

## Vocabulary Terms

1. Rendering
    - Rendering refers to showing the output in the browser. The DOM establishes parent-child relationships, and adjacent sibling relationships, among the various elements in the HTML file.
2. Templates
    - Code Templates are reusable code snippets that allow you to quickly insert commonly used code fragments or surround given code fragment with a meaningful code block.
3. State
    - React components has a built-in state object. The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.

## Preview


1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?
    - React. I've heard about React Framework, but have never used it before
    - Rendering elements in browser (We did it using Vanilla JS and jQuery)
2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    - I want to get more familiar with React
    - Sass. We've never used it before
3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    - React
    - SASS
    - There is a lot of new for me. I am really interested to learn more about JS libraries and frameworks
