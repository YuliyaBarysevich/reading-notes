## How to Solve Programming Problems

**Common mistakes:**

- Trying to start writing code as soon as possible
- Trying to over solve the solution on the first iteration

**Set of steps to solve programming problems:**

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.


## How to think like a programmer

> “Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

The best way to solve problems involves: 

1. Having a framework.
2. Practicing it.

**Framework:**

1. Understand it
    - Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.
    - Write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it.
2. Plan it  
    - Don’t dive right into solving without a plan. Plan your solution!
    - Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
3. Divide it
    - Do not try to solve one big problem.
    - Break it into sub-problems, then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest.

**If you are stuck...**

- Debug 
  - Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.
- Reassess 
  - Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective.
- Sidenote 
  - Another way of reassessing is starting anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.


## 5 Whys technique

5 Whys technique (sometimes known as 5Y) is a simple but powerful tool for cutting quickly through the outward symptoms of a problem to reveal its underlying causes, so that you can deal with it once and for all.

> Sakichi Toyoda, the Japanese industrialist, inventor, and founder of Toyota Industries, developed the 5 Whys technique in the 1930s

**How to Use the 5 Whys:**

1. **Assemble a Team**
    - Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. 
2. **Define the Problem**
    - Observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.
    - Write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"
3. **Ask the First "Why?"**
    - Ask your team why the problem is occurring.
    - Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.
4. **Ask "Why?" Four More Times**
    - Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
5. **Know When to Stop**
    - Stop asking why when the responses are no longer useful
6. **Address the Root Cause(s)**
    - If you identified at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.
7. **Monitor Your Measures**
    - Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem.
