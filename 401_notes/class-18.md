## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are serverless functions?
    - serverless functions are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies.
2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
    - I would try to build event-driven app to detect events and fire functions as they occur
3. Describe how a CDN works
    - To minimize the distance between the visitors and your websiteâ€™s server, a CDN stores a cached version of its content in multiple geographical locations.
    - CDN puts your content in many places at once, providing superior coverage to users. _(For example, when someone in London accesses US-hosted website, it is done through a local UK point of presence.)_

## Vocabulary Terms

1. Serverless Functions
    - A serverless function is a programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier
2. Cloud Storage
    - Cloud storage is a way for businesses and consumers to save data securely online so that it can be accessed anytime from any location and easily shared with those who are granted permission. Cloud storage also offers a way to back up data to facilitate recovery off-site.
3. CDN
    - Content Delivery Network is a highly-distributed platform of servers that helps minimize delays in loading web page content by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.
