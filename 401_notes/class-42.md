I had no idea that software engineers have Code of Ethitics, I think it is really meaningfully. Espiccially I liked **COLLEAGUES** principle. I think it is really important when people help and assist each other in professional field. Usually when people come to tech with no previous experience they need support from their colleagues to overcome imposter syndrome.  

Also I remembered SELF principle. I liked the idea it is included in Code of Ethitics. **"Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession..."** That is one of the resons why I decided to come to tech, possibility of continious learning. Doesn't matter how long you work in tech industry, you always have an opportunity to learn more.
