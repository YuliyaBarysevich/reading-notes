## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
    - First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a `request` for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that `response` is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.
2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
    - A server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client. On the Internet, the term "server" commonly refers to the computer system that receives requests for a web files and sends those files to the client.
3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
    - Software deployment refers to the process of running an application on a server or device. A software update or application may be deployed to a test server, a testing machine, or into the live environment, and it may be deployed several times during the development process to verify its proper functioning and check for errors.

## Vocabulary Terms

1. [Server](https://www.infotech.co.uk/blog/it-infrastructure-what-does-a-server-actually-do#:~:text=A%20server%20is%20a%20computer,piece%20of%20your%20IT%20infrastructure.)
    - A server is a computer that serves information to other computers. These computers, called clients, can connect to a server through either a local area network or a wide area network, such as the internet.
2. [Pub/Sub](https://ably.com/topic/pub-sub)
    - Architectural design pattern that provides a framework for exchanging messages between publishers and subscribers. This pattern involves the publisher and the subscriber relying on a message broker that relays messages from the publisher to the subscribers. The host (publisher) publishes messages (events) to a channel that subscribers can then sign up to.
3. WRRC
    - The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren’t working).
