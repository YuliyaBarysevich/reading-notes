## Description
This is a collection of my readings for CodeFellows.

### About Me
I'm Yuliya (Julia). Originally I am from Belarus, but I left my country when I was 17. I studied International Law in Vilnius, Lithuania. I have not finished the last semester due to many circumstances. Then I came to USA and started a small business.

When I realized I want to learn coding I started looking for the right place. I understand I don't want to spend 4 years in college to learn theory. I want to practice as much as possible. After reserching I found A Code Fellows and I think it was a great decision to enroll here.

Taking Code Fellows classes is a challenge for me. I want to see if I can be successful as a software engineer.
