## Why diversity matters to your tech company?

>Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. 

1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 
    - Studies indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation. 
2. Diverse companies perform better
    - Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. 
3. Companies are losing out on great talent 
    - Failing to attract and hire employees from underrepresented backgrounds leads companies to miss out on incredible talent.
    - By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is at the table. 
4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base.
    - When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
