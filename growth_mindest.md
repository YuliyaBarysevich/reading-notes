# Growth Mindest  

Growth mindest is Freedom. **You can be whoever you want to be**. 

> Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed no hope at all. 
> - Dale Carnegie  

I believe people who believe their talents can be developed _(through hard work, good strategies, and input from others)_ have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset _(those who believe their talents are innate gifts)_. This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning. 


Here is **_3 reminders_** to keep myself in a growth mindest:

* I am inspired by others people's success
* I keep trying and never give up
* My mistakes help me to be better
